## Presentations, mostly about OpenStreetMap

Presentations include how-to's, introductions, quality control tools. All presentations are offered under CC-BY-SA.
You are free to use them, provided you cite the original and make downstream additions available under the same terms. But be aware that some of these are a bit dated and the OpenStreetMap infrastructure, interface, and community have changed significantly since these were created.
